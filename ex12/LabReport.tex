\section{The small-world hypothesis}
\label{sec:small world}
% Here give your statement of the small-world hypothesis and how you
% are going to test it.

any two people can be in distance less or equal than 5.

I create the Dijkstra method to calculate the distance from every else node to the specific node.
And the result shows that there are no more than 5 distance.

\section{Complexity Arguments}
\label{sec:complexity}
% Write down the complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm and of Floyd's algorithm.
% Explain why, for these graphs, Dijkstra's algorithm is more efficient.

complexity for dijkstra: O((m+n)logn) if use binary tree.
complexity for Floyd's algorithm: O(N^3)

Because the graphs contains many nodes. the time complexity for Dijkstra's algorithm is better.

\section{Part 1 results}
\label{sec:part1}
% Give the results of part one experiments.

Which node you want to act as source?

% PART 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Part 2 complexity analysis}
\label{sec:complexity2}
% Give the complexity of the heuristic route finder.
The time complexity is polynomial when the search space is a tree, there is a single goal state, and the heuristic function h meets the following condition:

{\displaystyle |h(x)-h^{*}(x)|=O(\log h^{*}(x))} |h(x) - h^*(x)| = O(\log h^*(x))
where h* is the optimal heuristic, the exact cost to get from x to the goal.
 In other words, the error of h will not grow faster than the logarithm of
 the "perfect heuristic" h* that returns the true distance from x to the goal.

 I think the time complexity should be less or equal than O(n)


\section{Part 2 results}
