Here is a description of where the data came from (not needed to do
the lab, but you might be interested). 

small.gx - a small graph. Good for testing, perhaps. 

email.gx - a graph of emails. A node represents a person, and a link
means that the person sent an email to the target node. Since most
email communication is two-way, if there is an edge from i to j, there
is likely to be an edge from j to i. 

The e-mail interchanges are between members of the Univeristy Rovira i
Virgili (Tarragona) compiled by R. Guimera, L. Danon, A. Diaz-Guilera,
F. Giralt and A. Arenas, Physical Review E , vol. 68, 065103(R),
(2003). The data comes from Alex Arenas's website,
http://deim.urv.cat/~aarenas/data/welcome.htm. 

polblogs.gx - a graph of hyperlinks between blogs. Each node
represents a blogger, and an edge between i and j means that blogger i
had in some blog a hyperlink to one of the blogs of blogger j. 

This was compiled by L. A. Adamic and N. Glance, "The political
blogosphere and the 2004 US Election", in Proceedings of the WWW-2005
Workshop on the Weblogging Ecosystem (2005). The data comes from Mark
Newman's website, http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/.
